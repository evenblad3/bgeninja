	<h1>3 - Object Mass</h1>
	<h3>Requirements</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="https://rangeengine.tech/" target="_blank">Range Engine</a> or <a href="https://upbge.org/" target="_blank">UPBGE 2.5b</a><a href="https://kitsuystudio.itch.io/upbge-026" target="_blank">+</a> is recommended, you can use any version.
	</p>

	<h3>The code</h3>
	<p>
		We'll be getting and setting an object's mass using the game engine function <span class="mono">mass</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fire up <span title="or UPBGE">Range</span> and open up text editor.
		Create a new python script and rename it as whatever you want, I'll be renaming it as <span class="mono">code.py</span>
		just to keep it easy to remember lol.
	</p>
	<p>
		Import the module, define the owner and get an object's mass.
		We'll be getting the default cube's mass and setting it to <span title="30 blender units">30 units</span>,
		if the mass was not 2. So the code looks like this.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-python">import Range
own = Range.logic.getCurrentController().owner
if own.mass != 2:
	own.mass = 2</code></pre>
	<p>
		Duplicate the cube, now your scene must be having two cubes in opposite direction.
		Like <span class="mono">Cube</span> in <span class="mono">X: 2.00</span> and
		<span class="mono">Cube 2</span> in <span class="mono">X: -2.00</span>.
		Add a plane under both cubes like a see-saw like this.
	</p>

	</figure>
	<p>
		Select the <span title="which was Cube">first cube</span>
		and go to logic editor, add a mouse sensor and add a python controller.
		Select our <span class="mono" title="or whatever you renamed it as">code.py</span> script
		and connect the logic bricks.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now run the game. If your plane which has two cubes above it has freezed after 2-4 seconds,
		go to physics setting and turn on <span class="mono">No Sleeping</span>.
		This prevents the object which has phyics running from deactivating the simulation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Try running the game again. It should look something like this and if it runs as expected that's cool!
