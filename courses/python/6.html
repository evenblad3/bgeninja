	<h1>Mouse</h1>
	<p>
		In this lesson we'll be capturing mouse input with python inside the game engine.<br>
		To check if the mouse input is being captured we'll make a button and capture the mouse
		location.
	</p>
	<h3>Tracking our mouse position</h3>
	<p>
		Create two properties in the default cube named as
		<span class="mono">mouseX</span> and <span class="mono">mouseY</span>
		leave it as floating point integers and to the coding part...<br>
		Import the game engine module, make a function that runs in a loop,
		define the controller and owner object.<br>
		We now gotta tell what our previously created properties are going to do,
		so now we'll assign both of them to <span class="mono">bge.logic.mouse.position</span>
		and these properties lets us know the position of our mouse.
	</p>
<pre><code>try:
    import bge # Blender Game Engine
except:
    import Range as bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController() # the script

def main(cont): # the start
    own = cont.owner # scripts object
    mouse = bge.logic.mouse # mouse list
    
    # Tracking mouse position
    own["mouseX"], own["mouseY"] = mouse.position</code></pre>
    <p>
    	And the logic bricks setup looks like this.

	<h3>Method 1</h3>
	<p>
		To check the mouse input we check the mouse input in the
		<span class="mono">.activeInputs</span> just like we did in last lesson.
		So we do something like this.
	</p>
<pre><code>if 116 in mouse.activeInputs:
    print("Less Gooo")

# or an alternative way of doing it is like below
if bge.events.LEFTMOUSE in mouse.activeInputs:
    print("Less Gooo")</code></pre>
    <p>
    	So for left and right clicks we do the following.
    </p>
<pre><code>if 116 in mouse.activeInputs:
    print("Less Go Left!")
if 118 in mouse.activeInputs:
    print("Less Go Right!")</code></pre>
    <p>
    	We have our setup working, if necessary feel free to check the
    	<a href="https://rangeengine.tech/api/15/html/api/bge.events.html#mouse-keys" target="_blank">
    	Range Engine documentation</a> to check the keycodes for the mouse input and
    	<a href="https://rangeengine.tech/api/15/html/api/bge.events.html#mouse-keys">download the project file</a>.

		Pending... Please wait I'll finish this as soon as possible.
