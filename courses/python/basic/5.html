	<h1>Keyboard</h1>
	<p>
		In this lesson we'll be making use of our keyboard using python.
		There are different ways of checking the keyboard input,
		and we'll take a look at two of them.
	</p>
	<h3>Method 1</h3>
	<p>
		We'll import the game engine module as usual and we need
		<span class="mono">bge.logic.keyboard</span> which is wrapped in
		<span class="mono" title="If you don't know what this is its okay :)">
			SCA_PythonKeyboard</span> class.<br>
		This attribute has a dictionary which is <span class="mono">.activeInputs</span>
		which holds the active input of the keyboard.<br>
		So our code will be looking like:
	</p>
	<!-- Original code by KitsuyStudio at https://kitsuystudio.itch.io -->
<pre><code>try:
    import bge
except:
    import Range as bge
def main(): # main function
    cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController() # the script
    own = cont.owner # scripts object
    keysdown = bge.logic.keyboard.activeInputs # keyboard list</code></pre>
    <p>
    	Now in order to check if this is working, we add a cube and leave the name
    	as <span class="mono">Cube</span> and make it move.<br>
    	We'll check if the keyboard has any active keys in the
    	<span class="mono">.activeInputs</span> like this
    </p>
    <pre><code>x = 0.0 # set x
if 45 in keysdown: # look for W key in list, 45 = W key
    y = 10.0 # set y</code></pre>
    <p>
    	Checking if the key <b>W</b> is in that dictionary so for remaining
    	all <b>A</b>, <b>S</b> and <b>D</b> keys we'll do the following.
    </p>
    <pre><code>x = 0.0 # set x
if 45 in keysdown: # look for W key in list, 45 = W key
    y = 10.0 # set y
elif 41 in keysdown and not 45 in keysdown:
    y = -10
else:y = 0.0 # no W key in list
z = 0.0 # set z

if 23 in keysdown and not 26 in keysdown:
    zt = 100.0/4
elif 26 in keysdown and not 23 in keysdown:
    zt = -100.0/4
else:zt = 0.0</code></pre>
	<p>
		If you are bit confused how <b>45</b> means <b>W</b> you can look at
		<a href="https://rangeengine.tech/api/15/html/api/bge.events.html#keyboard-keys" target="_blank">the documentation</a>,
		and here are the keycodes for the four keys.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>W = <u>bge.events.WKEY</u> or <u>45</u></li>
		<li>A = <u>bge.events.AKEY</u> or <u>23</u></li>
		<li>S = <u>bge.events.SKEY</u> or <u>41</u></li>
		<li>D = <u>bge.events.DKEY</u> or <u>26</u></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Now to check if it's working we print <span class="mono">keydown</span>.
		Open up the system console by going to <b>Window -> Toggle System Console</b>.<br>
		By the way, this is how our code looks.
	</p>
<pre><code>try:
    import bge
except:
    import Range as bge
def main(): # the start
    cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController() # the script
    own = cont.owner # scripts object
    keysdown = bge.logic.keyboard.activeInputs # keyboard list
    x = 0.0 # set x
    if 45 in keysdown: # look for W key in list, 45 = W key
        y = 10.0 # set y
    elif 41 in keysdown and not 45 in keysdown:
    	y = -10.0
    else:y = 0.0 # no W key in list
    z = 0.0 # set z
    
    if 23 in keysdown and not 26 in keysdown:
        zt = 100.0/4
    elif 26 in keysdown and not 23 in keysdown:
        zt = -100.0/4
    else:zt = 0.0

    print(keysdown)</code></pre>
	<p>And this is how the logic bricks setup look.</p>

		<figcaption>Logic Bricks Setup</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Now when we run the code it should look something like below.</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/ropap66508/whDhHp.gif" alt="Logic Bricks Setup">
		<figcaption>User input being checked</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		For the cube to move just add these two lines replacing
		<span class="mono">print("keysdown")</span>.
	</p>
<pre><code>own.applyForce((x, y, z), True) # True = local
own.applyTorque((0.0, 0.0, zt), True) # True = local</code></pre>
	<p>
		And finally that's it, we have a working keyboard setup written in python.<br>

	<h3>Method 2</h3>
	<p>
		Now we'll be doing the keyboard input by checking the
		<span class="mono">bge.logic.keyboard.events</span> dictionary.<br>
		Make import the game engine module, create a function and name it as <b>main</b>
		or whatever you like. I think naming it as main is good, so we'll go with it and
		we this time create a list for movement and rotation.<br>
		Oh we also need to define what our <span class="mono">bge.logic.keyboard</span>
		is going to be, we'll name it as <b>keyboard</b>. We need a speed variable which
		is not going to be changed, so it will be constant.
	</p>
	<pre><code>try:
    import bge
except:
    import Range as bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

def main(cont):
    own = cont.owner
    keyboard = bge.logic.keyboard # Get the keyboard events

    movement = [0, 0, 0] # elements are considered as X, Y, Z
    rotation = [0, 0, 0]

    SPEED = 10 # Constant value</code></pre>
    <p>
    	Declaring this in uppercase doesn't prevent us from changing the value,
    	its just meant to be a "pythonic" way.<br>
    	Now to the logic part, we check for user input like this.
    </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if bge.logic.KX_INPUT_ACTIVE in keyboard.inputs[bge.events.WKEY].status:
    movement[1] += speed # change Y axis value of movement
if bge.logic.KX_INPUT_ACTIVE in keyboard.inputs[bge.events.SKEY].status:
    movement[1] -= speed
if bge.logic.KX_INPUT_ACTIVE in keyboard.inputs[bge.events.AKEY].status:
    rotation[2] += speed # change Z axis value of rotation
if bge.logic.KX_INPUT_ACTIVE in keyboard.inputs[bge.events.DKEY].status:
    rotation[2] -= speed</code></pre>
    <p>
    	In this code we're basically checking for an active input in the list
    	<span class="mono">keyboard.inputs[bge.events.&ltSOMEKEY&gt].status</span>
    	which can either contain <span class="mono">bge.logic.KX_INPUT_NONE</span> or
    	<span class="mono">bge.logic.KX_INPUT_ACTIVE</span>. If so move our object.<br>
    	And finally for movement we do the following.
    </p>
<pre><code>own.applyForce(movement, True)
own.applyTorque(rotation, True)</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="mono">.applyForce()</span> and <span class="mono">.applyTorque()</span>
		accepts list or tuple, as our <b>movement</b> and <b>rotation</b> is already a list
		we'll pass it like that.<br>
		Here goes the full code.
	</p>
<pre><code>try:
    import bge
except:
    import Range as bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

def main(cont):
    own = cont.owner
    keyboard = bge.logic.keyboard # Get the keyboard events

    movement = [0, 0, 0]
    rotation = [0, 0, 0]

    SPEED = 10

    # Check for user input
    if bge.logic.KX_INPUT_ACTIVE in keyboard.inputs[bge.events.WKEY].status:
        movement[1] += speed
    if bge.logic.KX_INPUT_ACTIVE in keyboard.inputs[bge.events.SKEY].status:
        movement[1] -= speed
    if bge.logic.KX_INPUT_ACTIVE in keyboard.inputs[bge.events.AKEY].status:
        rotation[2] += speed
    if bge.logic.KX_INPUT_ACTIVE in keyboard.inputs[bge.events.DKEY].status:
        rotation[2] -= speed

    own.applyForce(movement, True)
    own.applyTorque(rotation, True)</code></pre>
