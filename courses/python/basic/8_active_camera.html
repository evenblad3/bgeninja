	<h1>8 - Active Camera</h1>
	<p>
		Create 3 cameras in the current scene, and now we'll move to the codeing part.<br>
		Import the game engine module, define the current python controller and the owner object if
		necessary.<br>
		Our scene shows us the current active camera, so let's define our current scene and get
		active camera like so. Oh also put it in a function if necessary.
	</p>
<pre><code>try:
    import Range
except:
    import bge as Range
    
cont = Range.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner
scene = Range.logic.getCurrentScene()

def main():
    print(scene.active_camera)</code></pre>
    <p>
    	For now we print to know what our active camera is.<br>
    	If you've tried to run the game without looking thru a camera and just run the game
    	in normal viewport your console would be printing
    	<span class="mono">__default__cam__</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Now we have 3 cameras in the scene and we don't want to look through the normal
    	viewport. So we check if our camera is in the default viewport and if so, we will
    	randomly look through one of our 3 cameras which we've added previously.
    </p>
<pre><code>try:
    import Range
except:
    import bge as Range

import random

cont = Range.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner
scene = Range.logic.getCurrentScene()

def main():
    if scene.active_camera.name == "__default__cam__":
        scene.active_camera = random.choice(scene.cameras)
    else:pass
    </code></pre>
    <p>
    	Here after the <span class="mono">main()</span> we check if our camera is
    	<span class="mono">__default__cam__</span> and if so we randomly choose
    	a camera from the list <span class="mono">scene.cameras</span>.<br>
    	The reason why we used <span class="mono">name</span> attribute after
    	<span class="mono">scene.active_camera</span> is, <u>when you compare
    	them without that name attribute you are comparing your object with a string</u>.
    	This is not a vaild condition and hence it will not be satisfied.
