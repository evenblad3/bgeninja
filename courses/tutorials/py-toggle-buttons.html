	<h1>Toggle Buttons</h1>
	<p>
		In this tutorial website, we'll be creating the toggle mechanism using python.
		We will turn on and off a light.
	</p>
	<h3>Scene Setup</h3>
	<p>
		Create a dark environment and add a spot lamp, creating a dark environment
		is simple as pie! Delete everything in the scene, set the horizon and zenith
		colors to some dark color, add a plane and scale it to 10, add a spot lamp
		and bring it on Z axis to something around 10. Should be looking something like
		this.

	<h3>Coding</h3>
	<p>
		Let's import our module, define the current controller, get the owner and create
		a function that runs in a loop named as <span class="mono">main()</span>.
	</p>
	<pre><code>try:
    import Range
except:
    import bge as Range
    
cont = Range.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner

def main():
    pass</code></pre>
    <p>
    	We need to get our object's name which is a lamp and in python, its type will be
    	<span class="mono">KX_LightObject</span> which is a subclass of
    	<span class="mono">KX_GameObject</span>.
    </p>
    <pre><code>def init():
    if "init" not in own or own["init"] == False:
        own["init"] = True
        own["toggle"] = True</code></pre>
    <p>
    	We create a function that runs once even though its wrapped with a sensor
    	that runs in a loop. We also created a property that controls the light.<br>
    	Now let's code the toggle mechanism, let's work on the looping function.
    	We check for the user's input and if that certain input was triggered,
    	we turn on the light.<br>
    	Let's add an always and a keyboard sensor to the controllers.
    	It looks something like this.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <pre><code>def main():
    if own.sensors["Keyboard"].positive and own["toggle"] == False:
        own["toggle"] = True
    elif own.sensors["Keyboard"].positive and own["toggle"] == True:
        own["toggle"] = False</code></pre>
    <p>
    	Here, we check that if the keyboard sensor is triggered and if the property
    	<span class="mono">toggle</span> was False, we set it to True and
    	<span title="if the keyboard sensor is triggered and if the property
was True, we set it to False">vice versa</span>.
    </p>
    <pre><code>def main():
    if own.sensors["Keyboard"].positive and own["toggle"] == False:
        own["toggle"] = True
    elif own.sensors["Keyboard"].positive and own["toggle"] == True:
        own["toggle"] = False

    # Light toggle part goes below
    elif own["toggle"] == True:
        own.scene.objects["Spot"].energy = 1.0
    elif own["toggle"] == False:
        own.scene.objects["Spot"].energy = 0.0
    else:
        pass</code></pre>
    <p>
    	Here we check that if the <span title="own['toggle']">property</span> was True
    	we set the light's energy to 1.0, <span class="mono">light</span> attribute
    	needs a float when pass the value to it. Then on the third <b>elif</b> it happens
    	vice versa. Finally if none of them takes place, we do nothing.<br>
    	Here is the full code.
    </p>
    <pre><code>try:
    import Range
except:
    import bge as Range
    
cont = Range.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner

def init():
    if "init" not in own or own["init"] == False:
        own["init"] = True
        own["toggle"] = True

def main():
    if own.sensors["Keyboard"].positive and own["toggle"] == False:
        own["toggle"] = True
    elif own.sensors["Keyboard"].positive and own["toggle"] == True:
        own["toggle"] = False
    elif own["toggle"] == True:
        own.scene.objects["Spot"].energy = 1.0
    elif own["toggle"] == False:
        own.scene.objects["Spot"].energy = 0.0
    else:
        pass</code></pre>
    <p>
    	The final result should look something like this.
