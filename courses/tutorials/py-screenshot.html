	<h1>Screenshots using Python</h1>
	<p>
		We'll be taking screenshots with Python and saving them
		to our desired directories and preventing screenshots from being overwritten,
		let's get started/
	</p>
	<h3>Creating A Scene</h3>
	<p>
		Let's create a simple scene by adding some lights, some cubes adding some
		mist to the scene, etc.
		I added:
		<ul>
			<li>A cube with a python code that helps the cube to move</li>
			<li>Sun with a bigger shadow frustum size of 40.0</li>
			<li>Mist with start at 5.0 and depth at 30.0</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Just a rough scene, we just want know how the screenshot is taking with
		python.
	</p>
	<h3>The Code</h3>
	<p>
		We'll working without the keyboard logic brick this time.
		Let's import our main module which is <span class="mono">Range</span>
		if it is Range Engine and <span class="mono">bge</span> if its UPBGE
		and we'll specify our directory with <span class="mono">logic.expandPath()</span>
		like so.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-python">try:
    import bge
except:
    import Range as bge
from os import path

user_name = path.expanduser("~") # Get user's directory
dir = bge.logic.expandPath(user_name+"\\Documents") # Join with Documents folder

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()
def scrnsht(cont):
    keysdown = bge.logic.keyboard.activeInputs
    space = bge.events.SPACEKEY

    if space in keysdown:
        print(dir)</code></pre>
    <p>
    	The code might look complicated but lemme break it down for you:
    	<ul>
    		<li>Try importing bge module, if failed import Range as bge</li>
    		<p>
    			Because Range developers has changed the <b>bge</b> name
    			as <b>Range</b>. So we import the module, as bge so our code
    			is easy to edit.
    		</p>
    		<li>Get the user's name and directory</li>
    		<li>Join the user's directory with <span class="mono">\Documents</span></li>
    		<p>
    			So when the print the <span class="mono">dir</span> from the python code
    			its prints your user name with the documents folder.
    		</p>
    		<li>To make the code shorter we've defined "keysdown" and "space".</li>
    		<li>If the user has triggered <span class="mono">space</span> the we print the <span class="mono">dir</span>.</li>
    	</ul>
    <p>
    	This help us to execute the code a lot easier without the need of changing the
    	user name when the path has another user's name and shared with others.
    	If you've gotten the directories printed more than one time, we need to setup
    	a property that only triggers the <b>print(dir)</b> once.<br/>We add a property "once" and use
    	it to prevent from triggering thr print() more than once. Here's the code.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">try:
    import bge
except:
    import Range as bge
from os import path

user_name = path.expanduser("~") # Get user's directory
dir = bge.logic.expandPath(user_name+"\\Documents") # Join with Documents folder

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

def scrnsht(cont):
    own = cont.owner
    
    if "once" not in own: # Add "once" property if it doesn't exist
        own["once"] = True # Set it as TRUE
    
    keysdown = bge.logic.keyboard.activeInputs
    space = bge.events.SPACEKEY

    if space in keysdown and own["once"] == True: #If user pressed and once is true
        print(dir) # print our "dir"
        own["once"] = False #set "once" as FALSE, prevents from running again.
    if space not in keysdown: # If "space" is not pressed
        own["once"] = True # Set "once" to True</code></pre>
    <p>
    	Nice, now for the screenshot part we need to add
    	<span class="mono">bge.render.makeScreenshot()</span> and inside the function
    	parenthesis, we'll add our "dir" which holds our directory data
    	and our image name which looks like this.
    </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">try:
    import bge
except:
    import Range as bge
from os import path

user_name = path.expanduser("~") # Get user's directory
dir = bge.logic.expandPath(user_name+"\\Documents\\bro#") # Join with Documents folder
# and take multiple shots without overwriting the image

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

def scrnsht(cont):
    own = cont.owner
    
    if "once" not in own: # Add "once" property if it doesn't exist
        own["once"] = True # Set it as TRUE
    
    keysdown = bge.logic.keyboard.activeInputs
    space = bge.events.SPACEKEY

    if space in keysdown and own["once"] == True: #If user pressed and once is true
        bge.render.makeScreenshot(dir) # Take screenshots
        own["once"] = False #set "once" as FALSE, prevents from running again.
    if space not in keysdown: # If "space" is not pressed
        own["once"] = True # Set "once" to True</code></pre>
	<p>
		nice, it works here and it must be working for you too.

		<p class="what">Avoiding low-res screenshots</p>
		<p>
			The screenshots are taken respective to the screensize your game is running
			in. If your game size is 1920x1080 your screenshots will be in that
			dimensions.
