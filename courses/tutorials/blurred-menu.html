	<h1>Blurred Menu</h1>
	<p>
		In <a href="../logic-bricks/11.html">Logic Bricks, Lesson 11</a> there's a
		<a href="../logic-bricks/11.html#project-file">project file for pause menu</a>,
		we can use it for the pause mechanism if you'd like to make it without creating
		buttons and stuff. Open up the project file, navigate to the game scene.
		Select the camera and add a "2D Filter" actuator and connect it with the "Keyboard"
		sensor which brings the "pause" scene,
		the sensor doesn't need to have true level triggering turned on. Because
		we want our filter to be applied on our game scene and not on our pause scene.
	</p>
	<p>
		Set the "Filter 2D Type" to Blur. Run the game, if you're not
		satified with the filter here is you can use this blur filter. 
		Pase the code in the text editor, set the filter type to <b>Custom Filter</b>
		and choose your code.<br>
		Add an always sensor and another 2D Filter actuator which removes the custom filter.
		connect them both and turn on true level triggering in the always sensor.
		The way this works is, <u>when the game is running it checks for the blur filter
		and if it find the filter running it removes it. When the keyboard is pressed,
		the filter turns on for an instant and the game is paused with the filter in the
		game</u>.<br>
