	<h1>Screenshots using Logic Bricks</h1>
	<p>
		Ayo we'll be taking screenshots with Logic Bricks and saving them
		to our desired directories, without further ado let's get started.
	</p>
	<h3>Creating A Scene</h3>
	<p>
		Let's create a simple scene by adding some lights, some cubes adding some
		mist to the scene, etc.
		I added:
		<ul>
			<li>A cube with a python code that helps the cube to move</li>
			<li>Sun with a bigger shadow frustum size of 40.0</li>
			<li>Mist with start at 5.0 and depth at 30.0</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		I know the scene looks absolute crap, but we just wanna make sure how
		to perform screenshots with the engine.
	</p>
	<h3>The Logic</h3>
	<p>
		 Alright, now let's add logic bricks. Now select our camera and add a keyboard
		 sensor with any button assiged to it, add a <b>Game</b> actuator, set the
		 type to <b>Screenshot</b> and connect the logic bricks. Before you play the game
		 and take tons of screenshots, you need to specify the path and name
		 of your screenshot. So the name goes like this:
		 <span class="mono">C:/path/to/yo/folder/ur-name</span>.
		 Now try running the game and take screenshots.
	</p>
	<h5>Single sceenshots only appears?</h5>
	<p>
		So, you would've triggered your keyboard sensors mulitple times and wondered why
		you get only a single image. The reason is its getting overwritten and
		to prevent that you need to put
		<span class="mono">#</span> so it looks like this:
		<span class="mono">C:/path/to/yo/folder/ur-name#</span>.
		Now try running the game again and voila! The <b>#</b> helps to take mulitple
		screenshots as much as you want which replace by incremental index without
		overwriting by previous ones.
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p class="what">Avoiding low-res screenshots</p>
		<p>
			The screenshots are taken respective to the screensize your game is running
			in. If your game size is 1920x1080 your screenshots will be in that
			dimensions.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		If your screenshot is having the debug profiler included, it can be solved
		by turning it off.
