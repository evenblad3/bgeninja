	<h1>Implementing Cheats</h1>
	<p>
		In this tutorial, we're going to implement cheat codes inside our game project.<br>
		Without any further ado, let's get started.
	</p>
	<figure title="ngl this was one of my most favourite games of all time,&#010;I love playing this game so much and this tutorial was inspiered by this game lol">

	<h3>Keyboard</h3>
	<h5>Logic Bricks Setup</h5>
	<p>
		Open up the logic bricks, add an always sensor,
		a keyboard sensor which is going to record
		our keystrokes and a python controller having it's script type to
		<b>Module</b>. Create a new property, name it as <span class="mono">record</span>
		whose data type will be <b>boolean</b> and another property named as
		<span class="mono">cheats</span> whose type will be <b>string</b>.<br>
		Moving to the keyboard sensor we've just added, we need to record the keys we're
		pressing so enable <b>All Keys</b>. The <b>Log Toggle</b> field asks for a property
		which let's us to record the keystrokes, if the property is false we
		<u>can't</u> record our keystrokes,
		so go ahead select our property <span class="mono">record</span>
		in that field and set it True (just enable it lol). The <b>Target</b> field asks
		for a property with which we record our keystrokes, so select our
		<span class="mono">cheats</span> property in that field.<br>
	</p>

		If you run the game, you can that our keystrokes are being recorded.

	</figure>
	<h5>Python Setup</h5>
	<p>
		Create a new file, name it as <span class="mono">cheats.py</span>,
		define the necessary like below.
	</p>
	<pre><code>try:
    import Range # I'm using Range Engine
except:
    import bge as Range

cont = Range.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner # define owner

def main(): # got the owner, so no need of using "main(cont)"
    pass</code></pre>
    <p>
    	Now the <span class="mono">main</span> runs in a continuos loop, we need to check
    	our <u>cheat code</u>. Before that I'd like to create some code for our cheats.
    	<ul>
    		<li><u>nogravity</u> - sets the world gravity to 0</li>
    		<li><u>iamspeed</u> - player moves very fast</li>
    		<li><u>abigcube</u> - spawns a big cube</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    	Here are some cheats, the first two cheats changes the default value. If
    	we type the same cheat again, we must be able to get it back to normal mode.<br>
    	Now to implement it, we check the if any of the above cheats was typed
    	we trigger what must be triggered.
    </p>
    <pre><code>def main():
    if "nogravity" in own["cheats"].lower() and own.scene.gravity.z != 0.0:
        own.scene.gravity = 0,0,0
    elif "nogravity" in own["cheats"].lower() and own.scene.gravity.z == 0.0:
        own.scene.gravity = (0,0,-9.80)</code></pre>
    <p>
    	Here our cube floats when the cheat is enabled but when you type again,
    	gravity doesn't go back to normal. So we need to clear the text field by doing so.
    </p>
    <pre><code>def main():
    if "nogravity" in own["cheats"].lower() and own.scene.gravity.z != 0.0:
        own.scene.gravity = 0,0,0
        own["cheats"] = ""
    elif "nogravity" in own["cheats"].lower() and own.scene.gravity.z == 0.0:
        own.scene.gravity = (0,0,-9.80)
        own["cheats"] = ""</code></pre>
    <p>
    	If this was hard to understand, let me break it down for ya:
    	<ul>
    		<li>We have a function that runs in a loop.</li>
    		<li>Checks if the user typed that certain cheat.</li>
    		<p>
    			Checks if the user typed <span class="mono">nogravity</span> and
    			if the gravity's Z axis was not equal to zero.<br>
    			<span class="mono">.lower()</span> converts any letters that
    			are randomly in capital to lower.
    		</p>
    		<li>we set the gravity to zero in Vector form as (0,0,0).</li>
    		<li>Clear the <span class="mono">cheats</span> property's texts.</li>
    		<li>Checks if user typed the same cheat.</li>
    		<p>
    			We check if the user typed the same cheat again and the gravity's Z axis
    			is equal to zero.
    		</p>
    		<li>
    			Then we set gravity back to <span class="mono">-9.80</span>.
    		</li>
    		<li>Clear the texts.</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    	And then we need to implement two more cheats, which are <b>iamspeed</b> that
    	changes the player's speed and <b>abigcube</b> that spawns a big cube in front
    	of the player. But we haven't created the player's movement, so we'll make one.
    	You can <a href="#skip">skip to this part</a> if you're not interested making the movement
    	code.
    </p>
    <pre><code>if "speed" not in own:
    own["speed"] = 1/8 # int type, this is important

def move():
    keysdown = Range.logic.keyboard.activeInputs
    x = 0
    z = 0

    if 45 in keysdown: # 45 = W key
        y = speed
    else:
        y = 0.0
    
    if 23 in keysdown and not 26 in keysdown:
        zt = speed
    elif 26 in keysdown and not 23 in keysdown:
        zt = -speed
    else:
        zt = 0.0
    
    own.applyMovement((x, y, z), True)
    own.applyRotation((0.0, 0.0, zt), True)</code></pre>
    <p>
    	The code might look complicated but lemme break it down for you.
    	<ul>
    		<li>W.I.P.</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    	For part you need an always sensor that runs in a loop, enable true
    	level triggering.
    </p>
    <p id="skip">
    	Now we've created the player movement, now we check if the player typed
    	"iamspeed"
    </p>
    <pre><code>def main():
    cheats = own["cheats"].lower() # Defined to avoid lengthy lines

    if "nogravity" in cheats and own.scene.gravity.z != 0.0:
        own.scene.gravity = (0, 0, 0)
        own["cheats"] = ""
    elif "nogravity" in cheats and own.scene.gravity.z == 0.0:
        own.scene.gravity = (0, 0, -9.80)
        own["cheats"] = ""

    # "iamspeed" Part here
    elif "iamspeed" in cheats and own["speed"] == 1/8:
        own["speed"] = 1
        own["cheats"] = ""
    elif "iamspeed" in cheats and own["speed"] == 1:
        own["speed"] = 1/8
        own["cheats"] = ""
    else:
        pass</code></pre>
    <p>
    	The main reason <span class="mono">own["speed"] = 1/8</span> is it results in
    	shorter float whose value will be <span class="mono">0.128</span>. If you have
    	defined it <b>speed</b> property as 0.1 the float be will something like
    	<b>0.100000022912</b> or so, which can be frustrating to
    	check that cheat for the second time.<br>
    	And if you have defined <b>speed</b> instead of
    	<span class="mono">own["speed"]</span> you might enounter
    	<span class="mono">UnboundLocalError</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Now for the final part, we're going to spawn a big cube infront of the player.
    	For that we need to copy the orientation and position of the player. Instead
    	of writing code that need to deal with <span class="mono">Vector</span>, we can
    	simply parent an <b>Empty</b> to the player. Must be looking something like this.
    </p>

    	<figcaption>Example setup for spawing objects</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
    	Now we need to add the code that spawns the object...
    </p>
    <pre><code># Spawn object mechanism
elif "abigcube" in cheats:
    own.scene.addObject("dacube", "spawn", 0)
    own["cheats"] = ""</code></pre>
    <p>
    	In the <span class="mono">addObject()</span>, we put the name of our object
    	we're going to spawn as string and name of spawning object as string which is
    	used to copy the position, rotation and scale to spawn "dacube".
