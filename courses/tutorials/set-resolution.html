	<h1>Set Resolution</h1>
	<p>
		In this tutorial, we will get and set screen resolution of our game,
		let's get started.<br>
		<!-- We'll be doing:
		<ul>
			<li>Centering the mouse</li>
			<li>Recalculate the UI position</li>
			<li>Save the settings</li>
		</ul> -->
	</p>
	<p>
		Fire up the game engine, create a new text file, save it as
		<span class="mono">reso.py</span>, import the game engine module
		and necessary stuff
	</p>
	<pre><code>try:
    import Range as bge
except:
    import bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner

def reso(cont):
    pass</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now we get the screen resolution and print it on a property.
		I am a lazy guy, i dont create property by going to logic bricks,
		create a property, create a new one, blah blah blah...<br id="debug-prop-in-py">
		No, I got a new method for you where u can create a property inside python and
		debug without touching logic bricks! For that, we create two new properties named
		as "X" and "Y" which will be inside a <span class="mono">init</span> function.
	</p>
	<pre><code>def init(cont):
    if "init" not in own or own["init"] != True:
        own["init"] = True
        # List of properties goes here.</code></pre>
    <p>
    	So we've created an "init" function that must run only once, it only runs once
    	even if true level triggering was enabled in a sensor. Let's add some properties
    	and debug them.
    </p>
    <pre><code>def init(cont):
    if "init" not in own or own["init"] != True:
        own["init"] = True
        own["X"] = 0.0 # There's a ".", so it's a float
        own["Y"] = 0.0 # Float type</code></pre>
    <p>
    	Here we've added two properties and its value is not <span class="mono">0</span>
    	but <span class="mono">0.0</span> which means, its a floating point integers.
    	If you assign a <span class="mono">True</span> or <span class="mono">False</span>,
    	the list would be a boolean type property.<br>
    	Now let's debug the property.
    </p>
    <pre><code>def init(cont):
    if "init" not in own or own["init"] != True:
        own["init"] = True
        own["X"] = 0.0 # There's a ".", so it's a float
        own["Y"] = 0.0 # Float type
        own.addDebugProperty("X", True)
        own.addDebugProperty("Y", True)</code></pre>
    <p>
    	To check if this works, add an always sensor, two python controller with
    	script type set as <b>Module</b>, name the first one as
    	<span class="mono">reso.init</span>, the second one as 
    	<span class="mono">reso.reso</span> and connect them.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Now we'll move to the <span title="which is reso.reso">looping function</span>,
    	we'll get the screen width and height.
    </p>
    <pre><code>def reso(cont):
    own["X"] = bge.render.getWindowWidth()
    own["Y"] = bge.render.getWindowHeight()</code></pre>
    <p>
    	Now we got our info, now we need to set the resolution. We can either
    	set the resolution either with a property or just be defining them,
    	We'll go to our <span class="mono">init</span> function and create two
    	new properties that sets the resolution.
    </p>
    <pre><code>def init(cont):
    if "init" not in own or own["init"] != True:
        own["init"] = True
        own["X"] = 0.0 # There's a ".", so it's a float
        own["Y"] = 0.0 # Float type
        own.addDebugProperty("X", True)
        own.addDebugProperty("Y", True)
        if "width" or "height" not in own:
            own["width"] = 640 # Integer type
            own["height"] = 480 # Integer type</code></pre>
    <p>
    	In this code we check that if the property <span class="mono">width</span>
    	or <span class="mono">height</span> doesn't exist, we create them
    	and set their values as <b>640x480</b>.<br>
    	Now let's jump to the looping function, and write the code that set the
    	resolution we need. We should not be keep setting the resolution, so we need
    	a keyboard sensor that does the job <b>once</b>. Add a keyboard sensor,
    	enable <b>Tap</b>,
    	connect it with the <span class="mono">reso.reso</span> controller.
    </p>
    <pre><code>def reso(cont):
    own["X"] = bge.render.getWindowWidth()
    own["Y"] = bge.render.getWindowHeight()
    if cont.sensors["Keyboard"].positive:
        bge.render.setWindowSize(own["width"], own["height"])</code></pre>
    <div class="note">
    	<p class="what">Note</p>
    	<p>
    		<span class="mono">render.setWindowSize()</span> only works
    		in the standalone player mode, not in the in-built embedded player.
    	</p>
    </div>
    <p>
    	Now launch the game in standalone player mode and trigger the keyboard,
    	it must set the window size to the values we've set.<br>
