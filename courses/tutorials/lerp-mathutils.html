	<h1>Lerping Transformations</h1>
	<p>
		Lerp also known as linear interpolation is used to smoothen the
		objects' transformations. In this tutorial we'll be lerping the
		location and rotation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fire up the engine, we create a cube, leave it as it is, create a plane
		scale it to 5-10 and move the cube away from the plane to like 2-3 units.
		Now were going to write the code. We import our game engine module, define
		the controller and owner outside of the function which were wrapping it under
		the sensor which runs every frame.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-python">try:
    import bge
except:
    import Range as bge
cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner</code></pre>
	<p>
		Were going to copy the position and rotation of our plane and set it to our
		cube. For this we're going to use <span class="mono">localPosition</span> and
		<span class="mono">localOrientation</span>, which helps us to copy the
		location and rotation.<br>
		Were going to access our cube whose name is <b>Cube</b> and
		our plane whose name is <b>Plane</b> by default and put them under a function.
		So the code below will be like this (not full code).
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-python">def main(cont):
    cube = own.scene.objects["Cube"]
    plane = own.scene.objects["Plane"]</code></pre>
	<p>
		Here we're accessing the name of "Cube" and "Plane" and define them as
		<span class="mono">cube</span> and <span class="mono">plane</span> repectively.
		then we set our cube's position equal to plane's position.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-python">try:
    import bge
except:
    import Range as bge
cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner

def main(cont):
    cube = own.scene.objects["Cube"]
    plane = own.scene.objects["Plane"]
    cube.localPosition = plane.localPosition</code></pre>
    <div class="know">
    	<p class="what">Accessing everything in the scene with <span class="mono">owner</span></p>
    	<p>
    		You can access every objects in the scene
    		using "owner" attribute like in the previous example code.
    		With this, you can connect the sensor to any object and access other objects.
    		There is no need to use <span class="mono">bge.logic.getCurrentScene()</span>
    		list.
    	</p>
    </div>
    <p>
    	Before running the game set the cube's collision to
    	<span class="mono">No Collision</span>, or the cube may spawn under the plane.
    	Your cube must look something like this.
    </p>
    <figure>
    	<img src="">
    	<figcaption>Cube's position same as the plane</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
    	After setting the cube's position we set its rotation as:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">cube.localOrientation = plane.localOrientation</code></pre>
    <p>
    	To test if this is working, rotate the plane.
    </p>
    <figure>
    	<img src="">
    	<figcaption>Cube's orientation same as the plane</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
    	Now here comes the lerp method, unlike setting the cube's transformation equal to
    	plane's transformation, we set the cube's transformation equal to itself,
    	use the lerp function and then put the plane's transformation inside the function.
    	Here is an example.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">cube.localPosition = cube.localPosition.lerp(plane.localPosition, 0.1)</code></pre>
    <p>
    	Now we comment (or delete) the line that copies the plane's position and write
    	the above code.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">#cube.localPosition = plane.localPosition
cube.localPosition = cube.localPosition.lerp(plane.localPosition, 0.1)</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now try running the game and your cube smoothly goes it assigned position.
		The above step applies to our cube's rotation too.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-python">#cube.localOrientation = plane.localOrientation
cube.localOrientation = cube.localOrientation.lerp(plane.localOrientation, 0.1)</code></pre>
	<p>
		the value <span class="mono">0.1</span> after our plane's position is the
		interpolation factor. It accepts between 0-1 as float. The greater the number, the faster
		it goes to it's assigned position.<br>
		Now your cube's rotation must be smooth <span title="right now">rn</span>.
		If you're still wondering how the code looks, here it is.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-python">try:
    import bge
except:
    import Range as bge
cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner

def main(cont):
    cube = own.scene.objects["Cube"]
    plane = own.scene.objects["Plane"]

    #cube.localPosition = plane.localPosition
    cube.localPosition = cube.localPosition.lerp(plane.localPosition, 0.1)
    #cube.localOrientation = plane.localOrientation
    cube.localOrientation = cube.localOrientation.lerp(plane.localOrientation, 0.1)</code></pre>
