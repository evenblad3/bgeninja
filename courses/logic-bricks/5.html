	<h1>5 - Playing Sounds</h1>
	<h3>Getting a sound from the Internet</h3>
	<p>making stuff when i get internet lol</p>
	<h3>Playing it in the game</h3>
	<p>
		Open the logic editor, add a <span class="mono">Mouse</span> sensor.
		The default type of event that is set in the <span class="mono">Mouse Event</span> is <span class="mono">Left Button</span>.
		Then add a <span class="mono">Sound</span> actuator and choose the file you want to play.

	<p>
		After choosing it, you'll be shown with settings like this.

	</figure>
	<p>
		Run the game and you'll... wait. When you click with your left button, the audio plays for an instance.
		Like...for 0.5ms. To avoid that, choose the <span class="mono">Play Mode</span> from <span class="mono">Play Stop</span> to <span class="mono">Play End</span>.
		Now run the game and your sound play.
	</p>
	<h5>Play Stop</h5>
	<p>Play Stop plays the audio file until the sensor is triggered.</p>
	<h5>Play End</h5>
	<p>Play End plays the audio file once when the sensor is triggered.</p>
	<h5>Back to our stuff</h5>
	<p>If you know what the above two does, then you must be knowing what <span class="mono">Loop Stop</span> and <span class="mono">Loop End</span> does.</p>
	<h3>How this can be used</h3>
	<p>This mechanism is used in many ways like when</p>
	<ul>
		<li>objects hit</li>
		<li>the player jumps</li>
		<li>mouse is hovered in menu buttons</li>
		<li>vehicles run</li>
		<li>characters speak</li>
		<li>etc</li>
	</ul>
