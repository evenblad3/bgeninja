	<h1>Logic Controllers</h1>
	<p>
		Logic Controllers are <span title="not really, python is better lol">useful</span> when you want
		to do some complex operations. Here are some list of controllers available in the engine.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>AND Controller</li>
		<li>Or Controller</li>
		<li>NAND Controller</li>
		<li>NOR Controller</li>
		<li>XOR Controller</li>
		<li>XNOR Controller</li>
		<li>Expression Controller</li>
		<li>Python Controller</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>AND Controller</h3>
	<p>
		Controller is activated when every sensor is triggered that is connected to that controller.
	</p>
	<h3>Or Controller</h3>
	<p>
		Activated when one of the sensor is triggered that is connected to that controller.
		Yes, any one.
	</p>	
	<h3>NAND Controller</h3>
	<p>
		Activated when every sensor is not triggered that is connected to that controller.
		Can be used for hover button effect.
	</p>
	<h3>NOR Controller</h3>
	<p>
		Same as above, activated when every sensor is de-activated.
	</p>
	<h3>XOR Controller</h3>
	<p>
		Activated when the sensors has mixed input, deactives when every sensor that is connected to
		the controller is turned on/off.
	</p>
	<h3>XNOR Controller</h3>
	<p>
		Activated when the sensor has the same input whether it is on/off.
	</p>
	<h3>Expression Controller</h3>
	<p>
		Can be used for stuff like <span class="mono">Conditional Statements</span> in python.
		Something like this: <u>If the property <b>coins</b> has value equal to or greater than 5,
		rotate the cube.</u> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nnZAUnj7sSeEmBoYmTpaUGcjWhEbilbu/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here is the project file</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also you can do stuff like toggling. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NWrSdWy87KN5WrINK1wsgHnHUIInFsEc/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here is the project file</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Python Controller</h3>
	<p>
		Used for running code, you'll soon learn about this in the comming python lessons.
		I'll explain the basics: <u>You can either run a full code or a certain part of the code called modules.</u>
	</p>
	<h5>Scripts</h5>
	<p>
		This is used the run the whole file. The performance can decrease as the module <span class="mono">Range</span> or <span class="mono">bge</span>
		is imported again and again in a loop manner. This slows your game performance down. Use it wisely.
	</p>
	<h5>Module</h5>
	<p>
		Used to run a part of the file called <b>modules</b>. The field must be written like this: <span class="mono">your_file.your_module</span>.
		Your file must have the <span class="mono">.py</span> extension or it may return errors.
