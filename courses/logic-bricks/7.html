	<h1>7 - Collision Stuff</h1>
	<p>
		We'll be making some collision stuff and with this, we can do a lot of stuff!
		Like if a car scratches a wall create sound, if a character is hit he makes noise, if he jumps make jump sound, and so.
	</p>
	<h5>What we'll be making</h5>
	<p>
		We'll be doing this: when the charecter picks up a coin, a sound plays (you know what sound it is).
	</p>
	<h5>Getting Sounds Ready</h5>
	<p>
		Take a model from the internet, one of the cool asset site is <a href="https://opengameart.org/" target="_blank" title="fr fr">OpenGameArt</a>,
		it got lot of cool stuff like textures, sounds, characters, <span title="idk what else to put lol">and more</span>! Okay now back to our business,
		take a sound from that website and fire up <span title="again, you can use UPBGE or Range nobody gives a shit. its up to you.">the engine</span>.
	</p>
	<h5>*gets a coin*</h5>
	<p>
		Yes, we want our player to get the coin and play that sound.
		So, make a player setup with which you can move and <span title="you know what i mean...">do stuff</span> or you can get one from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12IZYkjg5OLtjz3cevIwKNmmIxTIiUb8j/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.
		And then we'll be making a coin that disappears when the player hits it and plays the coin sound.
	</p>
	<p>
		Add an object that represents the coin (or you can model a very simple one by adding a circle, filling the circle with a face and extruding)
		and keep the coin selected.
	</p>
	<h5>The Logic</h5>
	<p>
		We can detect this collision stuff by either by material or property. Let's get our hands dirty with property.
		Add a property to our player by opening up properties panel or that side thing that shows up when you press <span class="mono">N</span>
	</p>

		<figcaption>Adding a property "coin"</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		You can set it as <span class="mono" title="floating point integer, got decimals">float</span>,
		<span class="mono" title="interger, positive and negative numbers">int</span>,
		<span class="mono" title="timer, usual timer thing">timer</span>,
		<span class="mono" title="boolean, true or false stuff">bool</span> or <span class="mono", title="string, usual text data">str</span>.
		Leaving as it is recommended (which is float by default).
	</p>
	<p>
		Select the player, add a <span class="mono">Collision</span> sensor.
		Add a sound actuator, connect them both and select the sound which you want to play.
		In the <span class="mono">Property</span> field, type the name of the property of the object that represents coin (we renamed it as <span class="mono">coin</span>).
		Just in case if the audio doesn't play fully, in the sound actuator that plays the coin sound, set the <span class="mono">Play Mode</span> to <b>Play End</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's run the game to see if that really worked lmao

		<figcaption>Testing the collision stuff which is almost complete</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		mmm... the sound plays but we forgot one thing. Which is to make the coin disappear! Let's select the coin, turn on <span class="mono">Ghost</span> in the <span class="mono">Objects Physics</span>.
		This actually makes the coin like ghost, which can clip into objects not reacting to collisions but <u>can detect collision</u>.
		Almost ready, make sure you have the coin selected <span title="coz i've been giving too much intructions">(sorry lol)</span> and add a collision sensor.
		Click on the <span class="mono">M/P</span> which toggles the mode that looks for a certain material. Click on that field and select your player's material.
		Add an <span class="mono">Edit Object</span> actuator, set the <span class="mono">Edit Object</span> to <span class="mono">End Object</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This means, the coin looks for an object that has that player material and if that object collides, the coin ends it life.
		Don't forget to connect them, only then it works. Now run the game!
