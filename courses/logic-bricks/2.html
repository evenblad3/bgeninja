	<title>Logic Bricks - 2</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>2 - Move and rotate objects</h1>
	<p>
		Previously we saw (if you saw) how logic bricks works and I hope you gave some tries with it.
		Now we're going to move an object with logic bricks when a key (any key you want) in the keyboard is pressed.
	</p>
	<h5>Position</h5>
	<p>
		<u>Select the object on which you want the mechanism to happen</u> and add a keyboard sensor (i selected the default Blender cube and added a sensor coz i wanted the cube to move),
		press the empty field near the <span class="mono">Key:</span> you'll see it gets highlight in blue color (depends on what theme you're using.
		I'm using the default <span title="UPBGE 2.6.009">UPBGE 2.6+</span> theme) saying <span class="mono">Press a key</span>.
		It's waiting for the user to press a key so whenever the user presses that certain key, this keyboard sensors is triggered.
		Press a key now if you haven't yet lol. And it should something like this.

	<p>Add an <b>And</b> controller and connect the sensor you added previously with the controller you just added. Now added a <b>Motion</b> actuator and connect it to the controller. On <span class="mono">Loc:</span> (which means Location) you'll be seeing <span class="mono">X: 0.00 | Y: 0.00 | Z: 0.00</span> Click on Y (you can click on whatever axis you like, for now I'm sticking with Y as W is used to move a character on Y axis i.e., front) and change value to 0.20 or something you want.</p>
	<p>Press <b>P</b> the game engine runs. Press W and the object moves!</p>

	<h5>Orientation</h5>
	<p>Now change values on <span class="mono">Rot:</span> (which means Rotation) and Press P to run the game. Your object now moves and rotates.</p>

	<p>
		If you don't like the way the object moves and rotates, Press the <b>L</b> to deactivate it. And now try running the game.
		This happens when the object moves in local axis. When the cube is rotated 45deg in X axis,
		the cube moves in the axis it is faced on the Y axis when it is moved in that axis.
