	<h1>6 - Spawn Objects</h1>
	<h3>Setting Up</h3>
	<h5>Read before you proceed</h5>
	<p>
		When you are spawning objects, the object which spawns it must be on active layer.
		And the object that is going to be spawned must be on invisible layer. In simple words,
		if you are spawning an enemy
		keep it on an invisible layer and keep the the spawner on active layer like this.
	</p>

		Spawning objects are easy lol. Ok first things first,
		add an <span class="mono">Empty</span> by pressing <span class="mono">Shift+A</span>.
		You can add any empties, I'll stick with <span class="mono">Plain Axes</span>.
	</p>

		<figcaption>List of available empties</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Place the empty wherever you want, I'll move the empty to <b>3</b> on <b>Z</b> axis.
	</p>
	<h5>Add Logic Bricks</h5>
	<p>
		Now added a sensor, I'll added a keyboard sensor and press a key.
		Add <span class="mono">Edit Object</span> actuator and on the <span class="mono">Object</span>,
		set the object you want to spawn. If you want your object to last forever (until the game runs or until some other object destroys it),
		Leave the <span class="mono">Time: 0.00</span> as it is. Don't forget to connect the actuator to the sensor, only then it works ðŸ˜Š.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now run the game and trigger the keyboard by pressing the key u set previously.
	</p>
	<h5>Linear and Angular Velocity</h5>
	<p>
		If you're wonder what those <span class="mono">Linear Velocity: X: 0.00 | Y: 0.00 | Z: 0.00</span> and <span class="mono">Angular Velocity: X: 0.00 | Y: 0.00 | Z: 0.00</span> does...
		It's just nothing but velocity created upon creation of that spawned object.
		When you spawn the object which was in the invisible layer, it just pushes/spins for an instance when spawned.

	<p>
		Here the monkey object's <span class="mono">Physics Type</span> is set to <span class="mono">Rigid Body</span>. And btw download the project file here <a href="https://shorturl.at/mo049" target="_blank" title="Discord, Mirror Link 1">project file</a>,
