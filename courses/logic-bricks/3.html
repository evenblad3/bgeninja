	<h1>3 - Enemy Stuff</h1>
	<h5>Building the Navmesh</h5>
	<p>
		Add a plane and add some cubes intersecting the plane something like this.
	</p>

	</figure>
	<p>
		And then we must create a <b>Navmesh</b> to make the enemies follow our character.
		Let's create a navmesh by selecting the ground and press <span class="mono">Spacebar</span>
		search for <u>navigation</u> and select <span class="mono">Mesh: Create Navigation Mesh</span>.
		And it must look something like this.		
	</p>

	<p>
		You may also find your navmesh screwed up something like this.

	</figure>
	<p>
		You have to actually select the faces and then delete them, you may also find the navmesh having some areas black in color.
		Delete them.
	</p>
	<h5>Playable Setup</h5>
	<p>
		So you want to make an enemy follow your character, let's do it. Make a player setup or get one from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12IZYkjg5OLtjz3cevIwKNmmIxTIiUb8j/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</a>
	</p>
<!-- 	<figure>

		<figcaption>Navmesh screwed up</figcaption>
	</figure> -->
	<p>
		Now add an object or import a 3D model if you want it to be as an enemy. Select it and dive into the logic editor.
	</p>
	<h5>Path following logic</h5>
	<p>
		Add an always sensor and add a <span class="mono">Steering</span> actuator.
		Set the <span class="mono">Behaviour</span> from <span class="mono">Seek</span> to <span class="mono">Path Following</span>.
		If you want to know how the path following is happening you can enable <span class="mono">Visualize</span> which is located at the bottom.
		Set the <span class="mono">Target Object</span> to your player object and <span class="mono">Navigation Mesh</span> to the navmesh we just created moments ago.
	</p>
	<p>
		Run the game and if it works, nice. Else, delete the navigation mesh and create one again. Make sure you don't mess them and making them not to work lol.
		And if you want to mess with the project file, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dw60UwzdVpID4IZVfpdmw-5J4-5s7obE/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">here</a> it is.
		And <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xhuPEDmSc8WjgfQ68WSkPlK2CipeH-JF/view?usp=drive_link">here</a> is another one.

	</figure>
	<p>
		Oh also, if your any of your characters sinking on the ground, change the object's <span class="mono">Physics Type</span> from
		<span class="mono">Static</span> to <span class="mono">Dynamic</span>.
