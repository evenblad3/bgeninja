	<h1>8 - Raycast</h1>
	<h3>Uses of raycast method</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Firing bullets</li>
		<li>Check object's name</li>
		<li>Detecting height</li>
		<li>Look for object's behind walls in a certain direction</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>The plan</h3>
	<p>
		We'll be checking if the object the ray is cast upon is a "good" or "bad" character.
		The ray touches the charecter and if the character is "good", we won't be able to shoot it.
		If "bad", we'll kick its ass.
	</p>
	<h3>Setting up</h3>
	<h5>Player Setup</h5>
	<p>
		We're going to setup up a simple <span title="FPS">First Person Shooter</span> type player setup.
		If you know how to make the FPS setup you can skip this part or go on.
		Fire up the engine, select the cube or add one if it's not there and scale it's local Z axis to 3.
		Ayo also turn on snapping if you want the position/rotation/scale to be in perfect transformation instead of <span class="mono">3.42495</span> blah blah.
		Also set the snapping type to <span class="mono">Increment</span>.
	</p>

	</figure>
	<p>
		After setting the scale to 3, apply the scale by pressing <span class="mono">Ctrl+A</span> and choose <span class="mono">Scale</span>.
		Now the scale must be back to <b>1</b>. This can avoid some problems with <span title="i forgor ðŸ’€">scaling</span>.
		Now jump to logic editor and make the character move. Oh since our character is a <span class="mono">Character</span>,
		we must set the phyiscs type to <span class="mono">Character</span>. And set the Collision shape to <span class="mono">Capsule</span>.
		Almost every FPS game has this type of setup for collision.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now for the camera view, you need to have your character and the camera like this.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/ropap66508/b74image.png" loading="lazy">
		<figcaption>Camera Setup</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The camera works this way: <u>When you move your mouse left and right, you character turns left and right.
		When you move your mouse up the down, your camera goes up and down.</u> This is how most of the FPS games work.
	</p>
	<p id="from_l9">
		For the character, add a <span class="mono">Mouse</span> <b>sensor</b> and set the <span class="mono">Mouse Event</span> to <span class="mono">Movement</span>
		Turn on true level triggering, only then the camera move every frame you move your mouse or it won't work as expected.
		Add a <span class="mono">Mouse</span> <b>actuator</b>, yes an actuator and change it's <span class="mono">Mode</span> to <span class="mono">Look</span>.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/ropap66508/baimage.png" loading="lazy">
		<figcaption>Mouse actuator settings</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This actuator tells that if the user moves the mouse on the <b>X axis</b> then the rotation of the object's axis will be <b>Z axis</b>.
		If the user moves the mouse on the <b>Y axis</b> then the rotation of the object's axis will be <b>X axis</b>.
		And yeah you can disable them too. Since this actuator is for the character, disable <span class="mono">Use Y axis</span> <u>or you character will be looking up and down like this</u> lol.
	</p>

	</figure>
	<p>
		Now for the camera, wait wait. Instead of adding the logic bricks manually, you can copy them.
		Select the camera and then the character, in the <span class="mono">3D View</span> go to <span class="mono">Object -> Game -> Copy Logic Bricks</span>.
		Alternatively you can press the spacebar and type <span class="mono">Copy Logic Bricks to Selected</span>.
		Nice.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ay the mouse is annoying, right? Uncheck the <span class="mono">Mouse Cursor</span> by going to <span class="mono">Render -> Display -> Mouse Cursor</span>.
	</p>

		<figcaption>Visiblity of the mouse cursor is turned off</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Yea you can also set custom cursor image from <u>Range Engine 1.5a</u>!
		Now that our player setup is over let's move to good boi bad boi setup.
	</p>
	<h5>NPCs Setup</h5>
	<p>
		Add a cube, create a property and name it as <b>good</b>.
		Duplicate it by pressing <span class="mono">Shift+D</span>, yes you gotta keep the object seperate and rename its property as <b>bad</b>.
		Okay rename the objects as good and bad too. Property with <b>good</b> will be renamed as <b>good</b> and vice versa for <b>bad</b>.
		This is just to keep them organized. You can set the phyiscs type to <b>Character</b> or leave it as it is. Not a problem.
	</p>
	<h3>The logic</h3>
	<p>
		For the raycasting logic select the <b>camera</b>, add <span class="mono">Ray</span> sensor and set the <span class="mono">Range</span> between 10 or 20 for now.
		In the <span class="mono">ðŸŽ® Property</span> field, type <b>bad</b> and add a <span class="mono">Message</span> actuator.
		In the <span class="mono">Subject</span> field of <u>that message</u>, type <b>bad_die</b>.
		If you know what I'm doing that's good or lemme explain: <u>If the ray sensor detects an object with that "bad" property, well send a message to that "bad" object as "bad_die".
		And that if that bad object recieves a message as "bad_die" the object ends itself.</u>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now select the bad object, add a message sensor type <span class="mono">bad_die</span> add a <span class="mono">Edit Object</span> actuator,
		set the <b>Edit Object</b> to <span class="mono">End Object</span>. Yea connect them and run the game. Btw <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I3nLQzG_gY1x8e3MeTYlcKEh65cfbqIg/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">download the project file here</a> yo!
	</p>
	<h5>Common problem(s)</h5>
	<p>
		If "bad" object doesn't disappear but when you move the camera around the it does,
		the reason behind the quite tricky.
		<u>The orientation of the camera is faced downward when it's <b>X axis is 0</b></u>.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/ropap66508/camera000.jpg" loading="lazy">
		<figcaption>Camera's default orientation, X: 0</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		And when you rotate the camera to face forward by setting it's <b>X axis to 90</b>,
		the ray goes upward as the camera's local positive Y axis is facing up.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/ropap66508/camera010.jpg" loading="lazy">
		<figcaption>Camera's ray when it's direction is +Y axis, X: 90</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		By default ray goes in <b>positive Y axis</b>.
		So the solution is to set the axis of the camera's ray to <span class="mono">-Z axis</span>.
		And it should work like it should.
	</p>
	<p>
		Have a nice day bruh!
