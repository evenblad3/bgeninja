	<h1>10 - Changing Cameras</h1>
	<h3>Making it</h3>
	<p>
		Changing cameras can be used in creating cutscens, changing views, <span title="i really dont know what examples to put lmao">etc</span>.
		First things first, fire up <span title="what ever bge fork you have it doesn't really matter.">BGE</span> and open up logic editor.
	</p>
	<h5>Creating cameras in the scene</h5>
	<p>
		Having the 3D viewport opened (its open by default lol), add some cameras like 2 - 3.
		Don't forget to rename your camera to whatver name you want so you know that it is the main one.
		I'll 3 cameras and keep them in different positions and angles. Something like this.
	</p>

	<h5>Creating the logic</h5>
	<p>
		Now dive into logic editor and select your main camera if you haven't selected.
		Add 3 Keyboard sensors and 3 <span class="mono">Scene</span> actuators.
		Press 1,2 and 3 for the three keyboard sensors respectively.
		Change the <span class="mono">Mode</span> of all <span class="mono">Scene</span> actuators,
		from <span class="mono">Restart</span> to <span class="mono">Set Camera</span> so that we can switch between cameras by pressing the 1,2,3 keys on the keyboard.
	</p>
	<p>
		Connect the sensors to the actuators, 1st sensor to 1st actuator, 2nd one to 2nd, and 3rd one to 3rd like this.

	<h3>Common problems and fixes</h3>
	<h5>for Laptop Users</h5>
	<p>
		If you are a laptop user and don't have <span class="mono">Numpad</span> on your keyboard,
		you'll find a red colored <span class="mono">Fn</span> key on it. And on your <b>QWERTY</b> keys,
		you'll find some red colored numbers, special characters on it and some icons on <b>Function Keys</b>.

	</figure>
	<p>
		Press the <span class="mono">Fn</span> key and press the letters which has numbers on it. That should work.
		This happens when users who don't have numpad on their keyboard may have <span class="mono">Emulate Numpad</span> turned on in <b>Blender User Preferences</b>.
