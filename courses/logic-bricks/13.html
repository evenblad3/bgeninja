	<h1>Near - 13</h1>
	<p>
		Near sensors are used to detect objects that comes near them.
	</p>
	<h3>The plan</h3>
	<p>
		Our player character will go near a monke and it goes up.
	</p>
	<h3>The logic</h3>
	<p>
		Add <span class="mono" title="its the monke bro">Suzanee</span>, add a near sensor and type <b>player</b>
		in the property field. Select our default cube and make them movable with motion sensors how you'll be able to move it.
		Add a <b>player</b> property to it. Now select our monkey and add a motion actuator and make it go up.
		If you want the monkey to go up and down, set our monkey's phyiscs type to <span class="mono">Dynamic</span>.
		Connect them if you haven't and run the game.
	</p>
	<p>
		If your monkey is not detecting the player, you need to enable <span class="mono">Actor</span> in the physics type.
		Now try running the game and it must work.
