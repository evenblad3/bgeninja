<body>
	<h1>Compile UPBGE (Windows only)</h1>
	<h3>Requirements</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A computer that can run Visual Studio 2019</li>
		<li>CMake</li>
		<li>Libraries dependencies</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Setting Up</h3>
	<p>
		Okay first things first,
		<a href="https://files01.tchspt.com/down/vs_Community2019.exe" target="_blank">download Visual Studio 2019 installer</a>.
		This is the link I used to download it, going to Microsoft's website
		and downloading it is not going to be straightforward.
		After opening the installer it looks like this.
	</p>

	</figure>
	<p>
		<b>Uncheck everything.</b> Yes, do it and check
		<span class="mono">Desktop Development with C++</span> because that's what
		we're going to need to compile the engine.
		On the left side where the <b>Installation Details</b> is, uncheck
		<span class="mono">Test Adapter for Boost Test</span> and
		<span class="mono">Test Adapter for Google Test</span>. We don't
		really need them. Installations can take a while depending on your internet's speed
		and computer specs.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the installation has been completed, Open Visual Studio.
		To make sure everything is working, we need some smol c++ code.
	</p>
	<pre><code>#include &ltwindows.h&gt
#include &ltiostream&gt
int main()
{
	std::cout&lt&lt"BGENinja\n";
	return 0;
}</code></pre>
	<p>
		If it worked, you are good to go! If not open up the VSInstaller uncheck and check
		<span class="mono">Desktop Development with C++</span>, click on "Modify".
		It must be working. Now you need to install CMake for making a .sln file.
	</p>
	<div class="know">
		<p class="what"></p>
		<p>
			A solution is a structure for organizing projects in Visual Studio.
			The solution maintains the state information for projects in two files:
			<ul>
				<li><span class="mono">.sln</span> file (text-based, shared)</li>
				<li><span class="mono">.suo</span> file (binary, user-specific solution options)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		Go to <a href="https://cmake.org/" target="_blank">cmake.org</a> and download
		the latest CMake version. When installing it, you may be asked with some options
		like below.
	</p>

		<figcaption>CMake asking to add itself it to PATH</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		As highlighted, it is recommended to add it to PATH for all users. 
	</p>
	<div class="know">
		<p class="what"></p>
		<p>
			PATH is an environment variable on Unix-like operating systems,
			DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, specifying a set of directories
			where executable programs are located.
			In general, each executing process or user session has its own PATH setting.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		After installing CMake, we need libraries to compile them.
		Thankfully the UPBGE developers has linked them.
		Go to <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/k9MW1KiZ#UOKzjh3IQ0GEgjQ6GUc7ug/folder/QsVFVIRb" target="_blank">mega.nz</a>,
		look for <span class="mono">win64_vc14</span> and download it. The size is <b>2GB</b>.
		After downloading the libraries, we need to create folders for UPBGE builds to
		keep them organized.
	</p>
	<p>
		Create a folder named "upbge" and put the
		<a id="src" href="https://kitsuystudio.itch.io/upbge-026" target="_blank">source code<img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/ropap66508/WF9wpi.png"></a>
		there, we dont really need this folder that much,
		just to keep them neat.
		And then for the libraries open the downloaded library
		<b>.zip</b> file and extract it named as <span class="mono">lib</span>.
		Now you must be having two folders namely
		<span class="mono">upbge</span> and <span class="mono">lib</span>.
		Open CMake (cmake-gui), select where your UPBGE source code is
		and where you want the binaries to be built.
	</p>
	<style type="text/css">
		#src img{
			display: none;
			left: inherit;
			position: absolute;
		}
		#src:hover img{
			display: block;
			box-shadow: 0px 10px 20px black;
		}
	</style>
	<figure>
		<img src="https://i.ibb.co/ZWdQG9P/image.png" alt="CMake GUI" loading="lazy">
		<figcaption>CMake asking for folders</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		After choosing the folders, click on configure.
		If you have specified a folder that doesn't exit, it may ask if you want to create one.
		Then specify the generator for our project which is
		<b>Visual Studio 16 2019</b>. Now CMake will be making the solution project
		and wait until it finishes, takes under 5 min. Then click generate,
		it will be generating the .sln file for you and after 2 min its done.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now go to "upbge" folder and you'll find bunch of files,
		but only one .sln file, which is <span class="mono">UPBGE.sln</span>
		if you've downloaded <b>2.5b</b> and <span class="mono">UPBGE2.x.sln</span>
		if <b>2.6+</b>. Open Visual Studio, drag the file and open it and there
		is where you can edit source code of UPBGE
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally to compile it, make sure
		<span class="mono">CMakePredefinedTargets</span> is selected,
		go to <u>Build -> Build -> 2 INSTALL</u>. Now it must be compiling.
	</p>

	<div class="note">
		<p class="what"></p>
		<p>
			If you're building UPBGE for the first time,
			it may take upto 1-2 hours. After you build them,
			Visual Studio only compiles to file you have made changes to
			and leaves the rest as it is after the first time.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		After compiling, go to folder where the solution file is located,
		goto <u>bin -> Release</u> and there is your <b>blender.exe</b>!
